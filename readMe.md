In this project, we look at implementation of different design patterns and principles in python:
1. Implementation of singleton design pattern
2. Class factory design pattern.
3. Dependency Injection
4. Design of Interfaces.

We have two applications the ImageStore and phonebook applications that implement these design principles especially the SOLID principle.
You can checkout an article https://medium.com/@okidijimmy/mastering-clean-code-harnessing-the-power-of-solid-principles-in-python-development-f7a09efa159d that I wrote on medium about SOLID principes.

Both projects have their own readMes
